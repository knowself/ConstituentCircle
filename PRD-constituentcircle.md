# Constituent Circle - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-03-30

## 1. Introduction

Constituent Circle is a web application designed to facilitate communication and engagement between constituents and their elected representatives. It aims to provide a centralized platform for constituents to connect with representatives, access information, participate in discussions, and stay informed about local and national governance. The platform also serves representatives by offering tools to manage constituent interactions, disseminate information, and gather feedback.

## 2. Goals

*   **Enhance Constituent-Representative Communication:** Provide seamless and organized communication channels.
*   **Increase Civic Engagement:** Empower constituents to participate more actively in governance.
*   **Improve Information Accessibility:** Offer a central hub for government information, representative profiles, and legislative updates.
*   **Streamline Representative Workflow:** Provide tools for representatives to manage constituent relations efficiently.
*   **Foster Community Building:** Enable constituents within the same districts or groups to connect and discuss relevant issues.

## 4. Features

### 4.1 Core Features

*   **User Authentication & Authorization:**
    *   Secure user registration (signup) and login (signin) using email/password. (Implemented using Convex Auth, bcrypt hashing - see `convex/auth.ts`, `convex/users_actions.ts`, Memory `a245140d-9b2f-4123-b74a-cb2535550f0d`, Memory `c3cdde5d-04dc-4a39-a503-93ae4929d4f3`).
    *   Dual login paths (Admin vs. Non-Admin). (Partially implemented - `app/admin/login`, `app/auth/login`).
    *   Role-based access control (RBAC) restricting access to features based on user roles. (Schema defined, implementation ongoing).
    *   Secure session management using tokens. (Implemented - `convex/auth.ts`, `context/AuthContext.tsx`).
    *   Password hashing (bcrypt). (Implemented - `convex/users_actions.ts`).
    *   Logout functionality. (Implemented - `context/AuthContext.tsx`).
    *   Case-insensitive email lookup during login. (Identified need - Memory `537e7caf-b006-438d-a663-8de643b9d722`).
*   **User Profiles:**
    *   Users can create and manage their profiles (name, contact info, address, district, etc.). (Schema exists in `convex/schema.ts`, UI partially in `app/(protected)/dashboard/page.tsx`).
    *   Representatives can manage detailed profiles including bio, office details, legislative interests. (Schema exists, UI needed).
*   **Directory & Search:**
    *   Directory of representatives searchable by name, district, or location. (Backend functions needed, UI needed).
    *   Constituents can find their representatives based on address/district. (Backend functions needed, UI needed).
*   **Communication Tools:**
    *   Secure messaging between constituents and their representatives. (Schema exists `communications`, backend/UI needed).
    *   Ability for representatives to send broadcast messages to their constituents. (Backend/UI needed).
    *   Discussion forums or groups for constituents. (Schema exists `groups`, backend/UI needed).
*   **Information Hub:**
    *   Representatives can post updates, news, and event information. (Backend/UI needed).
    *   Access to legislative information (e.g., bills, voting records - requires external integration or data population). (Future scope).

### 4.2 Administrative Features

*   **User Management:** Admins can view, create, edit, and deactivate user accounts. (Partially implemented - `app/admin/dashboard/users`, `convex/admin_queries.ts`).
*   **Role Management:** Admins can assign and manage user roles and permissions. (Backend/UI needed).
*   **System Configuration:** Settings for platform behavior, integrations, etc. (Partially implemented - `app/admin/dashboard/system`).
*   **Content Moderation:** Tools to moderate user-generated content (messages, posts). (Future scope).
*   **Analytics Dashboard:** Admins can view platform usage statistics. (Partially implemented - `app/(protected)/dashboard/analytics`, needs backend data).

### 4.3 Technical Features

*   **Real-time Updates:** Utilize Convex for real-time data synchronization (e.g., new messages, notifications). (Core Convex feature).
*   **Responsive Design:** UI adapts to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile). (Implemented via Tailwind CSS).
*   **Theming:** Light/Dark mode toggle with persistence. (Implemented - `components/theme`, `app/layout.tsx`, Memory `60ff707c-e040-4626-969a-26e258185440`).
*   **Error Handling & Resilience:** Robust error handling, especially around Convex client initialization and API calls. (Partially implemented - Memory `f7e2e3d3-ce2d-4375-a355-460311558e6c`, Memory `c01d2428-3894-4971-9cd6-7a3a77f987b7`, Memory `6d00c866-39cb-49a4-94ae-268a723d8a1a`).

## 5. Design & UX

*   **Clean & Intuitive Interface:** Easy navigation and clear information hierarchy.
*   **Accessibility:** Adherence to accessibility standards (WCAG).
*   **Consistent Branding:** Unified look and feel across the platform.
*   **Performance:** Fast load times and smooth interactions.

## 6. Technical Stack

*   **Frontend:** Next.js (App Router), React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS.
*   **Backend & Database:** Convex (Managed backend service with real-time database).
*   **Authentication:** Convex Auth.
*   **Deployment:** Vercel.
*   **(Potential Future):** Email Service (e.g., Nodemailer, SendGrid) for notifications.

## 7. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Scalability:** System should handle a growing number of users and data. (Convex provides scalability).
*   **Security:** Protect user data and prevent unauthorized access. Implement security best practices (HTTPS, input validation, secure session management).
*   **Reliability:** High availability and minimal downtime.
*   **Maintainability:** Well-structured, documented, and testable code.

## 8. Future Considerations / Scope Creep Management

*   Password Reset Functionality
*   Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

*   Advanced analytics and reporting for representatives.
*   Mobile App (Native or PWA).
*   Event Scheduling/Management.
*   Polling/Survey tools.
*   Direct integration with social media platforms.

## 9. Open Questions

*   What are the specific permissions for each of the non-admin/constituent roles?
*   How will representative districts be defined and managed? (Manual input, GeoIP lookup, integration?)
*   What external APIs are planned for integration (e.g., legislative data, address verification)?
*   Specific requirements for content moderation?
*   Detailed workflow for constituent-representative communication?

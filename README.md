# Constituent Circle

## The Mission

Constituent Circle creates AI-enabled tools for more effective, opinionated, goal-oriented communications, at scale, for representatives and constituents to be assured they are being heard by each other.

Our vision is to enable representatives to conduct, at scale, effective, opinionated, goal-oriented conversations with thousands, tens of thousands or more individuals and groups. This is our vision of the kinds of super powers representatives in a representative democracy need.

## The Technology

We combine artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) to help representatives craft on-message emails efficiently while maintaining their own voice. Our system analyzes and learns from existing responses to create personalized templates tailored to the user's preference.

### Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Replit Database for data storage and management
- **Authentication**: Replit Auth for secure user authentication
- **Deployment**: Replit for hosting and deployment

## Tech Stack Versions

- **@heroicons/react**: ^2.0.18
- **@types/nodemailer**: ^6.4.17
- **@vercel/analytics**: ^1.1.1
- **ai**: ^4.0.20
- **Next.js**: ^15.2.0
- **@replit/database**: ^latest

## Database Configuration

Constituent Circle uses Replit Database as its backend service, providing persistent data storage with key-value pair functionality.

### Schema Design

Our database structure includes the following key patterns:

- **users:_{id}**: Stores user account information
- **sessions:_{id}**: Manages authentication sessions
- **profiles:_{id}**: Contains extended user profile information
- **communications:_{id}**: Tracks communications between representatives and constituents
- **constituents:_{id}**: Stores constituent-specific information


## Examples

Our tools help representatives have more meaningful conversations with their constituents. For example, when discussing climate change:

1. The tool asks constituents about their biggest concerns
2. Provides representatives with relevant information about climate change impacts in their district
3. Enables representatives to gather constituent input on addressing climate change locally

These tools also help with:
- Project management
- Idea development and refinement
- Schedule and deadline tracking
- Position improvement and constituent service

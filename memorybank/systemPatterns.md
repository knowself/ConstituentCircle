# System Patterns

This document outlines the key architectural patterns, design decisions, and coding conventions used throughout the Constituent Circle application. Following these patterns ensures consistency, maintainability, and scalability of the codebase.

## Architectural Patterns

### Next.js App Router Architecture

The application follows Next.js App Router architecture with a clear separation of concerns:

1. **Route Organization**
   - Route groups (in parentheses) for logical organization without affecting URL paths
   - Protected routes in dedicated directories with authentication middleware
   - Layout components for shared UI elements across related routes

2. **Data Fetching Strategy**
   - Server Components for initial data loading
   - Client Components for interactive elements
   - Convex real-time subscriptions for live updates

3. **Rendering Strategy**
   - Server-side rendering (SSR) for initial page load and SEO
   - Client-side navigation for subsequent page transitions
   - Static generation for content that rarely changes

### Backend Architecture

The Convex backend follows a domain-driven design approach:

1. **Function Organization**
   - Functions grouped by domain (users, communications, constituents)
   - Clear separation between queries, mutations, and actions
   - Internal functions for private operations

2. **Data Access Patterns**
   - Repository pattern through Convex database access
   - Optimized queries using appropriate indexes
   - Pagination for large data sets

3. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Role-based access control
   - Function-level authorization checks
   - Protected routes in the frontend

## Design Patterns

### Component Patterns

1. **Compound Components**
   - Related components grouped together
   - Example: Form components with FormField, FormLabel, FormInput, etc.

2. **Container/Presentational Pattern**
   - Container components handle data fetching and state
   - Presentational components focus on rendering UI
   - Example: Dashboard container with multiple presentational widgets

3. **Higher-Order Components (HOCs)**
   - Used for cross-cutting concerns like authentication
   - Example: `withAuth` HOC for protected components

4. **Render Props**
   - Used for component composition with shared logic
   - Example: `<DataLoader render={data => <Component data={data} />} />`

### State Management Patterns

1. **Context API for Global State**
   - AuthContext for authentication state
   - LoadingContext for application-wide loading states

2. **React Query for Server State**
   - Used with Convex for data fetching and caching
   - Optimistic updates for improved user experience

3. **Local Component State**
   - useState for component-specific state
   - useReducer for complex state logic

### Hook Patterns

1. **Custom Hooks for Reusable Logic**
   - `useAuth` for authentication operations
   - `useCommunications` for communication-related operations
   - `useDashboard` for dashboard-specific data and operations

2. **Composition of Hooks**
   - Building complex hooks from simpler ones
   - Example: `useProfileData` composed of multiple data-fetching hooks

## Code Organization Patterns

### File Structure Conventions

1. **Feature-Based Organization**
   - Related components, hooks, and utilities grouped by feature
   - Shared components in a common directory

2. **Index Files for Clean Imports**
   - Export related components from a single index file
   - Example: `import { Button, Card, Modal } from '@/components/ui'`

3. **Barrel Exports**
   - Re-export components and functions for cleaner imports
   - Example: `export * from './Button'` in index.ts

### Naming Conventions

1. **Component Naming**
   - PascalCase for React components
   - Descriptive names that indicate purpose
   - Example: `UserProfileCard.tsx`

2. **File Naming**
   - Component files match component names
   - Utility files use camelCase
   - Test files append `.test` or `.spec`

3. **Function Naming**
   - Verb-first for actions (e.g., `createUser`, `fetchData`)
   - Noun-first for queries (e.g., `userProfile`, `messageList`)
   - Boolean functions with `is`, `has`, or `should` prefix

## Data Patterns

### Convex Schema Design

1. **Table Organization**
   - Tables represent domain entities
   - Clear relationships between tables
   - Appropriate indexes for query optimization

2. **Document Structure**
   - Flat document structure where possible
   - Nested objects for closely related data
   - References to other documents via IDs

3. **Validation Patterns**
   - Strict validation using Convex validators
   - Consistent error handling
   - Shared validators for common patterns

### API Design Patterns

1. **Function Naming**
   - Queries: `get*`, `list*`, `search*`
   - Mutations: `create*`, `update*`, `delete*`
   - Actions: `process*`, `generate*`, `send*`

2. **Parameter Validation**
   - Consistent use of Convex validators
   - Clear error messages for validation failures
   - Default values where appropriate

3. **Return Types**
   - Consistent return structures
   - Nullable returns with appropriate validators
   - Error handling through exceptions

## Error Handling Patterns

1. **Frontend Error Handling**
   - ErrorBoundary components for graceful UI recovery
   - Try/catch blocks for async operations
   - Consistent error messaging to users

2. **Backend Error Handling**
   - Structured error responses
   - Appropriate HTTP status codes
   - Detailed logging for debugging

3. **Validation Errors**
   - Client-side validation before submission
   - Server-side validation as a security measure
   - Clear error messages mapped to form fields

## Testing Patterns

1. **Component Testing**
   - Unit tests for individual components
   - Integration tests for component interactions
   - Snapshot tests for UI regression

2. **API Testing**
   - Unit tests for individual functions
   - Integration tests for function chains
   - End-to-end tests for complete workflows

3. **Test Organization**
   - Tests co-located with implementation
   - Shared test utilities and fixtures
   - Consistent naming and structure

## Performance Patterns

1. **Rendering Optimization**
   - Memoization with React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback
   - Virtualization for long lists
   - Code splitting for large components

2. **Data Loading Optimization**
   - Pagination for large data sets
   - Incremental loading for improved perceived performance
   - Prefetching for anticipated user actions

3. **Asset Optimization**
   - Image optimization with Next.js Image component
   - Font optimization with next/font
   - Bundle optimization with proper code splitting

## Accessibility Patterns

1. **Semantic HTML**
   - Proper heading hierarchy
   - Appropriate ARIA attributes
   - Semantic elements over generic divs

2. **Keyboard Navigation**
   - Focusable interactive elements
   - Logical tab order
   - Keyboard shortcuts for power users

3. **Screen Reader Support**
   - Alt text for images
   - ARIA labels for interactive elements
   - Announcements for dynamic content changes

## Security Patterns

1. **Authentication**
   - Secure token handling
   - Protection against CSRF attacks
   - Proper session management

2. **Authorization**
   - Role-based access control
   - Resource-level permissions
   - Principle of least privilege

3. **Data Protection**
   - Input sanitization
   - Output encoding
   - Protection against common vulnerabilities (XSS, SQL injection)

## Conclusion

These patterns serve as guidelines for development and should evolve as the application grows and new requirements emerge. Consistent application of these patterns ensures a maintainable, scalable, and high-quality codebase.

When introducing new patterns, document them here and ensure the team is aware of the changes. Regular reviews of these patterns help identify areas for improvement and ensure they remain relevant to the project's needs.

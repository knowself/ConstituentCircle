# Architecture for Managing Tasks in Constituent Circle Platform

## 1. Overview
This document outlines the architecture for managing tasks and processes within the Constituent Circle platform using TypeScript. The system is designed to be scalable, reliable, and efficient, leveraging modern task management techniques.

## 2. Components
- **Task Queue**:  
  - **Bull**: A robust task and job queue library for Node.js that supports delayed jobs, retries, and concurrency.  

- **Job Scheduler**:  
  - **Agenda**: A lightweight job scheduling library for Node.js that allows for scheduling jobs at specific intervals or times.  

- **Monitoring and Logging**:  
  - **Prometheus and Grafana**: Used for tracking performance metrics and system health, providing alerts for failures or performance issues.  

- **Serverless Functions**:  
  - **AWS Lambda / Google Cloud Functions**: Executes TypeScript scripts without the need for server management, scaling automatically based on demand.

## 4. Task Management
### 4.1 Task Queue Implementation
- **Task Types**: Define various task types such as data processing, report generation, and communication handling.  
- **Worker Nodes**: Set up worker nodes using Bull to process tasks from the queue, ensuring efficient resource utilization.  

### 4.2 Job Scheduling
- **Scheduled Jobs**: Define jobs that need to run periodically, such as daily reports and weekly data aggregation using Agenda.  
- **Job Parameters**: Configure parameters for each job, including frequency and start time.  

## 5. Monitoring and Troubleshooting
### 5.1 Monitoring Setup
- **Performance Tracking**: Implement monitoring tools to track task performance and system metrics using Prometheus.  
- **Alert Configuration**: Set up alerts for task failures, performance degradation, and system health issues.  

### 5.2 Logging Strategy
- **Structured Logging**: Implement structured logging in all TypeScript applications to ensure traceability and easier debugging.

## 6. Integration with TypeScript
- Ensure that all components and libraries mentioned are compatible with TypeScript, allowing for type safety and improved maintainability.

## 7. Documentation
### 7.1 System Architecture Document
- Create a detailed document outlining the architecture, components, and workflows.

### 7.2 Code Documentation
- Ensure all scripts include comments and documentation for usage and error handling.

### 7.3 User Guides
- Develop user guides for representatives and staff on system interaction and troubleshooting.

## Next Steps
- **Finalize Architecture Diagram**: Create and insert the architecture diagram.  
- **Review with Team**: Share the draft with the team for feedback and revisions.  
- **Implement Documentation**: Start documenting the code and creating user guides.
